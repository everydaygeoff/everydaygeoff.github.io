			<p>Ever since I was a kid, I have had an interest in remote controlled anything. When I was younger, I had a few RC cars, like a Rebound that could drive even when flipped over, and another dune buggy style that was less forgiving when upside down.</p>
<p>However, anything that flew was prohibitively expensive and probably would not have survived my &ldquo;full throttle&rdquo; approach to RC vehicles.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the rise of hobbyist electronics, DIY drones, and cheap components with cheap shipping from China has made RC planes a lot easier to get into, and a lot easier to rebuild after the inevitable crash.</p>
<p>There is also an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2Y3ok-lTEE">amazing community</a> out there putting out videos and free plans around this hobby. In particular, the linked video inspired me to give my first RC plane a go.</p>
<h2 id="sneak-peek-and-improper-scale">Sneak Peek and Improper Scale</h2>
<p><img src="/img/19/02-Foam-Plane/02fp01.jpg" alt="Sneak Peak"></p>
<p>As seen above, the first attempt at this was a laughable mis-judgement of scale. At the time, all I could find was the smaller version of the glider. I charged ahead though every step of assembly, growing more and more wary of the frame I had chosen to build up. Once I got to the last step of strapping on the battery, I accepted that this was not going to be a good first plane for me.</p>
<p>Looking back on this with fresh eyes; If I had a smaller battery, it still might have flown, but it would have been a high speed bullet and overly sensitive to any shift in the center of gravity.</p>
<h2 id="once-more-but-bigger">Once more, but bigger!</h2>
<p>After sourcing a properly scaled foam glider, I got to work moving the components over and rebuilding the plane. This forced rebuild was a good learning experience, and I made a few choices on the second build motivated by mistakes made on the first.</p>
<p><img src="/img/19/02-Foam-Plane/02fp02.jpg" alt="ESC"></p>
<p>For the brushless motor, I printed a small disk with the proper mounting holes, and hot-glued the assembly into place. This was surprisingly strong, and held up under all full throttle tests.</p>
<p><img src="/img/19/02-Foam-Plane/02fp03.jpg" alt="Canopy"></p>
<p>The electronic speed controller (ESC) is probably my favorite part of this build. Using a hobby knife, I cut away the canopy and hollowed it out to make room for the electronics. I am very pleased with how clean the fit is.</p>
<p><img src="/img/19/02-Foam-Plane/02fp04.jpg" alt="Aileron Servo"></p>
<p>For the aileron servo, I hollowed out a small cavity for a snug servo fit, and used a bit of tape and glue to hold it in place. The control horn is 3d printed and glued into place, with a paperclip acting as a control rod.</p>
<p>The aileron itself is a piece of foamboard taped to the edge of the wing, with a bit of a gap to allow it to move. Not the cleanest solution, but it does give a fair bit of up and down deflection when the servo moves.</p>
<p><img src="/img/19/02-Foam-Plane/02fp05.jpg" alt="Wired up with Receiver"></p>
<p>At the center of the y made by the servo cables is the 4 channel receiver. To control the plane, I am using a Flysky i6 transmitter that came with a drone I picked up a few months ago.</p>
<p><img src="/img/19/02-Foam-Plane/02fp06.jpg" alt="Battery in Place"></p>
<p>The location of the battery made me a bit nervous, but this was the only location that would allow a proper center of gravity. I would have liked to hollow out the frame for a secure mounting spot, but I was running out of spare foam on the fuselage to carve away.</p>
<p><img src="/img/19/02-Foam-Plane/02fp07.jpg" alt="Crash Landing"></p>
<p>The local RC Flying club was kind enough to let me use their field for a test flight. At takeoff, the wheels provided little more than a lift to keep the prop from hitting the ground. I powered the length of the runway at about 6 feet off the ground that ended with a soft crash in some tall grass.</p>
<p>For the next flight, someone did a hand launch while I took the transmitter. This got much higher off the ground, but I found I had very little control over the aircraft. The plane climbed a bit higher before taking a nosedive beyond the treeline, where I found the picture from above.</p>
<p>If I were to build this again, I would probably put the control surfaces on the elevator and added a rudder. The surfaces all act on the center of gravity, and having things on the tail would have allowed the force to be applied to a longer arm. The ill fated setup had the control way to close to the center of gravity.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I had so much fun building this plane I didn&rsquo;t mind the crash that much. I packed up the broken remains of the plane to extract the electronics for the next build.</p>
