			<p>Slow Death Games is an indie game company that sells the Starbreach dice and rulebook, along with some awesome punk / youth subculture minis for their game &ldquo;Wild in the Streets&rdquo;. A few months ago on Instagram, they announced they were throwing some free stickers into new orders. I figured it was time to pull the trigger and order some minis. Yes, free stickers are what got me. In particular, the &ldquo;Love Miniatures, Hate Fascism&rdquo; piece.</p>
<p><img src="/img/20/09-sate-display-piece/09sdp01.jpg" alt="Haul"></p>
<p>When my order arrived, I was so excited to see they tossed in a bunch of stickers with my dice and Sate figure.</p>
<h2 id="base-coat">Base Coat</h2>
<p><img src="/img/20/09-sate-display-piece/09sdp0203.jpg" alt="1"></p>
<p>I started out with a gray primer and black wash, which really brought out the details I had missed when I first looked over the piece.</p>
<p><img src="/img/20/09-sate-display-piece/09sdp0405.jpg" alt="2"></p>
<p>I then painted up the pants with a blue ink with some transparency to let the underpainting show though. To highlight the edges, I did a drybrush with white mixed with a bit of that blue ink.</p>
<p>At first, I was going to do a blue hoodie, but that did not look quite right, so I re-primed the upper part gray and decided to go a bit darker.</p>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p><img src="/img/20/09-sate-display-piece/09sdp0809.jpg" alt="3"></p>
<p>After adding the main blocks of color, I started filling in details, like the buttons, shoe trim, and metal buckles on the messenger bag.</p>
<p>Looking over the pictures, I noticed a few spots I needed to clean up in the future, like in inconsistent covering on the back of the white spray paint can.</p>
<h2 id="backdrop">Backdrop</h2>
<p><img src="/img/20/09-sate-display-piece/09sdp10.jpg" alt="4"></p>
<p>I had a pretty good idea of where I wanted to go with this display piece, but I needed to make a few bits to bring it together. I wanted him standing on some sort of platform, with a brick wall behind him with some fresh graffiti.</p>
<p>To start I used a piece of 28mm scale brick wall I found on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3068132/">thingiverse</a>. I wanted it to be a bit more imposing, so I scaled it up from 30mm to about 50mm tall and called them cinderblocks instead of bricks. This was primed gray with my airbrush.</p>
<p><img src="/img/20/09-sate-display-piece/09sdp11.jpg" alt="5"></p>
<p>Using a vinyl cutter, I cut out an Anti-Fascist flag image into two separate black and red stencils. I figured the airbrush would make a nice &ldquo;spraypaint&rdquo; effect, and I was happy with the result.</p>
<p><img src="/img/20/09-sate-display-piece/09sdp12.jpg" alt="6"></p>
<p>Next, I finished up the Sate figure, repainting one of the paint cans black to match the tag behind him, and added the black to his shows. I also painted the whites of his eyes, but punked out on dotting the pupils. This display piece will live on my desk, and I can live with that blank stare. We can call it a &ldquo;Blank Stare of Defiance.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="finished">Finished</h2>
<p><img src="/img/20/09-sate-display-piece/09sdp14.jpg" alt="7"></p>
<p>The bottom piece I modeled in Blender. To approximate a curb, I created a base layer, a raised platform, and beveled the edge. There is a recessed space on the back for the wall, and a small slot in the middle to fit the bar attached to his feet. After some sanding and painting, I am happy with how smooth this turned out. The curb is primed gray, with a sepia wash to give it that &ldquo;sidewalk concrete&rdquo; look.</p>
<p><img src="/img/20/09-sate-display-piece/09sdp15.jpg" alt="8"></p>
<p>I had a ton of fun putting this piece together. With miniature painting and tabletop wargaming, I figured I would enjoy getting better at speedpainting and churning out squads of 5, 10, or 15 units, but this was a pleasant (maybe even preferable!) change of pace. It was fun to work on this here and there and put a little more effort into this as an art piece and explore some of its underlying themes.</p>
<p>I wanted to keep with the &ldquo;Love Minis, Hate Fascism&rdquo; that initially brought this piece to my workbench. Painting this up gave me the opportunity to explore this symbol and the current political and social climate I find myself in. I do not advocate for violence against any group for exercising a right to free speech. It is important to remember that words can quickly become actions, and a tolerance for hate speech allows it to take root, and grow into actions of violence and oppression of others. Personally, I see Anti-Fascist Action as a counterpoint to the rise in Nationalism, Authoritarianism, and Far-Right Extremism that threaten the democracy of this country and the truth that we are all members of the human race and should treat each other as such.</p>
