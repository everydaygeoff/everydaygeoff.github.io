      <description>The Mostly Printed CNC (MPCNC) is an entry level DIY kit for a small CNC milling machine developed by Ryan at V1Engineering. This well-documented project is supported by a huge community of tinkerers, hobbyists, and professional machinists who have contributed a multitude of add-ons to the machine.
This is a record of work performed and milestones reached on building my own MPCNC.</description>

      <title>EVA Spoilboard</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about this project for a long time. After I started using the needle cutter, I really wanted a vacuum table that could flatten the foamboard, and an underlying work surface that would not destroy the cutting tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a two week hiatus from the MPCNC, I got the itch to get back to making things. I wanted to salvage the spoilboard as much as I could, level it out, and create a few clamps to make workpiece holding a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hi! My name is Geoffrey Tuttle and I am an optical engineer from North Carolina. I received my Master&amp;rsquo;s in Optical Science and Engineering at UNC Charlotte, and my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s in Physics at UNC Greensboro.
My main area of research is in 3D printing technology, which has given me a fair bit of exposureÂ to optical, mechanical, and electrical engineering, as well as software experience in Matlab, python, and CNC programming.</description>

      <title>Making a Spoilboard and Breaking Things</title>
      <link>https://www.geofftuttle.com/projects/mpcnc/spoilboard/</link>

      <description>In the process of creating a spoilboard for the MPCNC, I came across several lingering issues with the machine that needed to be resolved. It ended up being an opportunity to correct a bunch of broken bits, tighten up nuts and bolts that had loosened, and come to terms with an accuracy problem I had been ignoring.
This project also gave me a chance to try a new method of documentation, and learn a lot about what works and doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for my creative workflow.</description>

      <description>After a few years of rebuilds, teardowns, and tool changes, I am finally adding a router to my MPCNC. I have been wanting to work more with sheet material like wood, acrylic, and even aluminum if I can get the hang of using this tool.
Router Choice and Prints For a router, V1 Engineering recommend the Dewalt 660, a 5.0 Amp, handheld rotary tool that operates at 30,000 rpm with an included 1/8&amp;quot; collet.</description>

      <description>This weekend, I got a chance to see the Antares rocket take off from Wallops Flight Facility. The facility is on the Atlantic coast of Maryland, and I am roughly 50 miles away on the west side of the Chesapeake. The mission was a resupply to the International Space Station, carrying cheese, nitrogen, and other essential items.
Camera Setup My wife and I got out there early enough to get my camera setup, a simple tripod holding a Canon T3i with a 55-250mm zoom lens.</description>

      <description>This blog is built using Hugo, a static website generator designed for quick build times and easy deployment. A static website requires no server backend, since everything is delivered in a static state to the reader (that&amp;rsquo;s you!). All code is executed on the client machine. I love the lightweight simplicity of a static website, which brings up some nostalgia for the internet of the mid to late 90s, when these types of pages were the norm.</description>

      <description>Slow Death Games is an indie game company that sells the Starbreach dice and rulebook, along with some awesome punk / youth subculture minis for their game &amp;ldquo;Wild in the Streets&amp;rdquo;. A few months ago on Instagram, they announced they were throwing some free stickers into new orders. I figured it was time to pull the trigger and order some minis. Yes, free stickers are what got me. In particular, the &amp;ldquo;Love Miniatures, Hate Fascism&amp;rdquo; piece.</description>

      <description>This past week has been a bit slow. I have been preoccupied with a lot of work-related things, and was not in much of a mood to work on the usual hobbies of painting/printing/casting. While I may not have created too much, I spent a lot of time this week taking walks in the neighborhood. I suppose I could say this created a clear headspace from which to move into the next week.</description>

      <title>Painting Minis and More Casting</title>

      <description>This has been a week with a lot of painting, a little casting, and a bit of thinking about future projects.
Painting Finished Tank Early in the week, I was able to wrap up my Schrek tank build, which gave me a chance to get some experience in basing. The base seen above was the third iteration, where I finally got the spacing between the dirt piles right. This allowed the tank sat on the base instead of floating above the rocks.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a pretty productive week, and I got a chance to try out a bunch of new things and get some ideas for future projects a bit outside my norm. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick recap of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to this week:
Magnets, Painting with Vallejo, and Basing To make my growing Battletech collection a bit more modular (and to keep from making/buying too many minis) I have been toying with the idea of swappable turrets and weapons for my pieces.</description>

      <title>Two Part Mold Making</title>

      <description>Today, we&amp;rsquo;re going to take a 3d printed tabletop miniature and replicate it with a two part mold. This will speed of production of a part that would normally take two to three hours, and give us the freedom of different materials and colors.
Two part molds allow us to cast more complex shapes than a one part, or open-face, mold. This open face creates a flat surface on the piece we are making.</description>

      <title>RC Plane With Needle Cutter</title>

      <description>I was chatting with a coworker the other day, and the conversation turned to RC planes. Turns out, he was in the same place in his RC journey as I was a few months ago! We talked over the resources we had been using to build planes and the equipment we had been using, and agreed to meet up soon to do some building and flying.
This coincidence and conversation renewed my interest in flying, and got me to fire up the needle cutter again to start making planes.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a bit of mulling over the last RC plane adventure, I decided to jump back in with another build. I wanted something that looked sharp, was somewhat compact, and dedicated to training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flitetest.com/articles/flite-test-tiny-trainer&#34;&gt;FT Tiny Trainer&lt;/a&gt;, a scratch-build design from Flite Test.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Ever since I was a kid, I have had an interest in remote controlled anything. When I was younger, I had a few RC cars, like a Rebound that could drive even when flipped over, and another dune buggy style that was less forgiving when upside down.
However, anything that flew was prohibitively expensive and probably would not have survived my &amp;ldquo;full throttle&amp;rdquo; approach to RC vehicles.
Fortunately, the rise of hobbyist electronics, DIY drones, and cheap components with cheap shipping from China has made RC planes a lot easier to get into, and a lot easier to rebuild after the inevitable crash.</description>

      <title>Laser Engraver Testing</title>

      <description>With the laser up and running, I wanted to try and dial in the settings to get good engravings and cut through some material. Most laser cutters are of the CO2 variety, which operate an order of magnitude faster than the MPCNC, and with two orders of magnitude more power.
There are lots of forum posts about setups similar to mine, but no two machines are alike, so I had to figure out my own parameters.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a proliferation of inexpensive diode lasers available from overseas ranging from 1 to 15 W. It is somewhat concerning that someone can purchase such a high powered blinding device so easily. It is also very tempting&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pen Plotting and Vinyl Cuts</title>

      <description>Now that the MPCNC is assembled and wired up, it&amp;rsquo;s time to make something! I decided to start with some simple actions with a pen plotter and vinyl cutter.
Pen plotting For the first action, I went with a simple vector outline of a Gundam head. I found the above image as a black and grayscale png, and used Inkscape to trace the outline into black and white vector shapes. This was imported in Estlcam, which generated the gcode for this plot.</description>

      <description>Soon after finishing the initial build, which was significantly scaled down from my original plans, a garage unit opened up in my apartment. I had been keeping an eye out for this, so I leased one, and moved some things down to set up a small shop.
I used this newly acquired space to scale the MPCNC up to it&amp;rsquo;s intended size; a 2&#39; x 3&#39; working area.
Fortunately, the most inexpensive parts of the machine are the parts that determine it&amp;rsquo;s size.</description>

      <description>After a few months of going back and forth on this idea, I decided to pull the trigger and build the Mostly Printed CNC (MPCNC). It is a CNC platform that can be assembled out of inexpensive electronics and hardware, EMT conduit, and 3d printed components.
Ryan at V1 Engineering sells a kit with all the electronics and hardware, leaving me to source a table, conduit, and print the parts. While waiting for the kit to arrive, I started the long process of printing.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine recently joined the 501st, a group of Star Wars fans who cosplay in full sets of screen-accurate Stormtrooper armor for charity events. He opted for a biker scout variant, which includes a distinct laser pistol as a sidearm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help complete his set of armor, I printed a replica of this blaster.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
