      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a pretty productive week, and I got a chance to try out a bunch of new things and get some ideas for future projects a bit outside my norm. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick recap of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to this week:
Magnets, Painting with Vallejo, and Basing To make my growing Battletech collection a bit more modular (and to keep from making/buying too many minis) I have been toying with the idea of swappable turrets and weapons for my pieces.</description>

      <description>Today, we&amp;rsquo;re going to take a 3d printed tabletop miniature and replicate it with a two part mold. This will speed of production of a part that would normally take two to three hours, and give us the freedom of different materials and colors.
Two part molds allow us to cast more complex shapes than a one part, or open-face, mold. This open face creates a flat surface on the piece we are making.</description>

      <description>Who Am I? Welcome! My name is Geoff, and I&amp;rsquo;m a maker. I grew up in rural North Carolina, bounced around the state picking up degrees in physics and optical engineering, and landed in Maryland with my wife and two cats. I enjoy building things out of wood, plastic, and whatever electronic components I can find. I also enjoy tabletop wargaming, hacking together remote control cars and planes, photography, sticker creation, and making my own t-shirt designs.</description>
