      <description>Today, we&amp;rsquo;re going to take a 3d printed tabletop miniature and replicate it with a two part mold. This will speed of production of a part that would normally take two to three hours, and give us the freedom of different materials and colors.
Two part molds allow us to cast more complex shapes than a one part, or open-face, mold. This open face creates a flat surface on the piece we are making.</description>

      <description>Who Am I? Welcome! My name is Geoff, and I&amp;rsquo;m a maker. I grew up in rural North Carolina, bounced around the state picking up degrees in physics and optical engineering, and landed in Maryland with my wife and two cats. I enjoy building things out of wood, plastic, and whatever electronic components I can find. I also enjoy tabletop wargaming, hacking together remote control cars and planes, photography, sticker creation, and making my own t-shirt designs.</description>
