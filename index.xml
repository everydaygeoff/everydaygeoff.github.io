      <description>Who Am I? My name is Geoff, and there are several words that could be used to describe me, the things I do, and the interests I have. I have a degrees in physics and optical engineering, personal and professional experience in 3d printing, and a guitar I pick up and play every now and then. I enjoy reading and writing rules of tabletop games, building and painting miniatures of various scales, and hacking together remote control cars and planes.</description>
