			<h2 id="the-original-blog">The Original Blog</h2>
<p>Back in 2016, I was in my last year of grad school and starting my job hunt. In addition to the countless resume iterations, endless job application websites, and a constant stream of coffee, I wanted to create something that would showcase some of my work. This is what kicked off my <a href="https://geoffreytuttle.wordpress.com">first blog</a>, which I hoped to serve as a somewhat professional portfolio.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure the blog helped me get a few interviews, but once I accepted a job offer, I did not put much effort into new posts. The blog has existed on Wordpress.com since then, with few updates and no traffic.</p>
<p>Or so I thought&hellip;</p>
<p>Earlier this week, I received an email inquiring about one of the posts, a <a href="https://geoffreytuttle.wordpress.com/2016/07/27/ikea-lamp-to-camera-mount/">3d printed camera mount for a lamp</a>. Someone was asking about an outdated link to the 3d printable part, with the intent to use it as part of their video setup! I was blown away to find my long-outdated post on a forgotten blog is adding a little bit of value to the community!</p>
<h2 id="abandoned-videos">Abandoned Videos</h2>
<p>This revelation reminded me of a few abandoned projects I still have floating around the corners of the internet. One of those projects is an Arduino circuit I assembled to control the output of a diode laser.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OuPI0QUAMOw" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>To me, this was an insignificant little project I threw together to make sure I understood how the laser worked. In the process of testing, I filmed a few clips, thinking I could add a little something to my rarely-updated social network pages. Once I figured out the diode controller, I ditched the Arduino part, and set up the laser for my CNC machine. When all was done, I assembled the video clips and uploaded to YouTube.</p>
<p>As of this writing, it&rsquo;s my most viewed video, and there have been several comments over the past year asking for a circuit diagram or the Arduino sketch. I didn&rsquo;t have any sources for this project, and I didn&rsquo;t think it was complicated enough to warrant reassembling the circuit, so I left the comments unanswered and moved on to different projects.</p>
<p>Receiving the email about the lamp was the push I needed to revisit this video, and add the relevant information people were asking for.</p>
<h2 id="finishing-what-i-started">Finishing what I started</h2>
<p>To make sure I had the correct circuit schematic and Arduino sketch, I recreated the original setup with the Arduino and potentiometer. Using an LED in place of the laser, I reworked the sketch until the microcontroller was performing as expected.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VH_DUzm1S2c" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Once I was satisfied with the script, I put together a clean circuit diagram, <a href="https://github.com/geoffworks/LaserPWM">added it to github</a>, and updated the original video description with the new information. With the source code and diagram, I can call this project complete.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<h3 id="anyone-can-do-but-not-everyone-does">Anyone can do, but not everyone does.</h3>
<p>There is so much good information and guidance on the internet. I can learn virtually anything with a well-worded Google search and investing the time to read and practice over what I find. I am amazed at the information people will assemble and share for free. I sometimes find these displays intimidating, especially when I compare it to my abilities and the things I post.</p>
<p>I am not an expert programmer, or engineer, or modeler. I am not the best at 3d printing, or painting, or web design. But I am sort of okay at some of these things, and can stumble through the rest. Everyone has a skill set and unique perspective that makes their work special and worth sharing. I want to keep that in mind as I keep posting projects. It&rsquo;s not about being the best, or the most thorough, but about doing my best and putting that out there.</p>
<h3 id="maintain-a-collection-of-projects">Maintain a collection of projects</h3>
<p>In addition to consistently posting projects, I need to work on maintaining what is out there. I want to make sure links stay updated, source material is referenced, and that my posts can exist in a standalone manner as much as possible. If I fail to provide enough information, and people reach out asking for clarification, I want to be the kind of person who is helpful and responsive.</p>
<p>In short: share more, share better, and be interactive.</p>
