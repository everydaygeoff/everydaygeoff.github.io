      <description>Slow Death Games is an indie game company that sells the Starbreach dice and rulebook, along with some awesome punk / youth subculture minis for their game &amp;ldquo;Wild in the Streets&amp;rdquo;. A few months ago on Instagram, they announced they were throwing some free stickers into new orders. I figured it was time to pull the trigger and order some minis. Yes, free stickers are what got me. In particular, the &amp;ldquo;Love Miniatures, Hate Fascism&amp;rdquo; piece.</description>

      <description>This has been a week with a lot of painting, a little casting, and a bit of thinking about future projects.
Painting Finished Tank Early in the week, I was able to wrap up my Schrek tank build, which gave me a chance to get some experience in basing. The base seen above was the third iteration, where I finally got the spacing between the dirt piles right. This allowed the tank sat on the base instead of floating above the rocks.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a pretty productive week, and I got a chance to try out a bunch of new things and get some ideas for future projects a bit outside my norm. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick recap of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to this week:
Magnets, Painting with Vallejo, and Basing To make my growing Battletech collection a bit more modular (and to keep from making/buying too many minis) I have been toying with the idea of swappable turrets and weapons for my pieces.</description>
