      <description>The Original Blog Back in 2016, I was in my last year of grad school and starting my job hunt. In addition to the countless resume iterations, endless job application websites, and a constant stream of coffee, I wanted to create something that would showcase some of my work. This is what kicked off my first blog, which I hoped to serve as a somewhat professional portfolio.
I am pretty sure the blog helped me get a few interviews, but once I accepted a job offer, I did not put much effort into new posts.</description>
