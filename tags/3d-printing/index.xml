      <description>After a few years of rebuilds, teardowns, and tool changes, I am finally adding a router to my MPCNC. I have been wanting to work more with sheet material like wood, acrylic, and even aluminum if I can get the hang of using this tool.
Router Choice and Prints For a router, V1 Engineering recommend the Dewalt 660, a 5.0 Amp, handheld rotary tool that operates at 30,000 rpm with an included 1/8&amp;quot; collet.</description>

      <description>After a few months of going back and forth on this idea, I decided to pull the trigger and build the Mostly Printed CNC (MPCNC). It is a CNC platform that can be assembled out of inexpensive electronics and hardware, EMT conduit, and 3d printed components.
Ryan at V1 Engineering sells a kit with all the electronics and hardware, leaving me to source a table, conduit, and print the parts. While waiting for the kit to arrive, I started the long process of printing.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine recently joined the 501st, a group of Star Wars fans who cosplay in full sets of screen-accurate Stormtrooper armor for charity events. He opted for a biker scout variant, which includes a distinct laser pistol as a sidearm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help complete his set of armor, I printed a replica of this blaster.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
