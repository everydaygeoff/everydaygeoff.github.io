<h3 id="who-am-i">Who Am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Geoff, and there are several words that could be used to describe me, the things I do, and the interests I have. I have a degrees in physics and optical engineering, personal and professional experience in 3d printing, and a guitar I pick up and play every now and then. I enjoy reading and writing rules of tabletop games, building and painting miniatures of various scales, and hacking together remote control cars and planes. I also enjoy film and digital photography, sticker creations, and making my own t-shirt designs. I suppose the best word to describe me is a maker.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;maker&rdquo; gets thrown around a lot these days. It is extremely vague, in that it doesn&rsquo;t describe what someone makes, how it is made, or who it is made for. A maker could just as easily refer to a garage woodworker using hand tools to build furniture, or a basement musician using GameBoys to craft electronic beats.</p>
<p>However, the power of the word &ldquo;maker&rdquo; lies in its ambiguity. It is a word that is free from constraints, and allows anyone flying that banner to explore creating whatever catches their fancy at any given moment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the lack of constraints can lead down a dark path of notebooks filed with half-baked ideas, a closet full of half-finished projects, and blogs full of unpublished draft pages. I have several dust-covered endeavors sitting on shelves, in corners of rooms, or in long-forgotten folders of hard drives.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-this-site">What is this site?</h3>
<p>To avoid continuing down the dark path described above, I hope this site serves as a collection of my projects and the processes by which I make things. I intend to use this site to share the things I make and the lessons learned though making. Ideally, this serves to filter out some of my more random ideas, and facilitate sharing in a coherent, mostly-easy-to-follow way.</p>
<h3 id="why-swampwire">Why SwampWire?</h3>
<p>Growing up and living in several rural areas of Eastern USA, from the mountains of North Carolina to the swamplands of Maryland, I have become really good at entertaining myself without having to go anywhere. I am thankful for a childhood filled with sticks as swords, rocks as magic crystals, and the backyard stream as an endless river wild. I hope to never outgrow that imagination, and &ldquo;swamp&rdquo; represents that endless wilderness I am still traversing and creating from.</p>
<p>When I was around 9-10 years old, in the mid-to-late 90s, I got connected to the internet. My mom had signed up with America Online, and she set up an account for me to use. I picked out my username and password, and from the moment I heard that dial-up connection sound, I was hooked. I spent hours browsing websites Nintendo cheat codes, R.E.M. lyrics (I loved &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the End of the World as We Know it&rdquo;), and using webrings, AOL Search, and Yahooligans to reach out across the net. I miss the days of using Instant Messenger to chat with friends, even though today there are a multitude of more convenient and more instant methods of communication available to use. &ldquo;Wire&rdquo; represents that connectedness with the world, regardless of physical location, and the ability to unite with people though shared interests, common experiences, and a joy of creating something together.</p>
<p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I am glad you are here, and hope this site encourages you to create and share the things that make you happy.</p>
